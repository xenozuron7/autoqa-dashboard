However, significant improvements are needed in call opening protocols, as the agent failed to introduce themselves, mention the brand, or provide a greeting. Crucially, the agent did not perform right party verification, proceeding with sensitive account details without confirming identity, which is a security breach. Additionally, the agent frequently interrupted the customer and exhibited unprofessional language use, including repetitive words, incomplete sentences, mixed English/Hindi, and excessive back-channel cues.",

However, significant areas for improvement were noted, particularly in the agent's failure to properly close the call, as they did not confirm if the customer had further questions or provide a professional closing statement. Additionally, the agent neglected to conduct proper party verification, which is crucial for security, and failed to acknowledge the customer's concerns with adequate empathy. The agent also interrupted the customer frequently, hindering effective communication and understanding.",

However, there are critical areas needing improvement, particularly in closing conversations appropriately by inviting further queries, which was lacking in the interaction. Additionally, the agent did not effectively utilize opportunities for cross-selling or upselling relevant features to enhance customer experience. Lastly, there were issues with email formatting, including spacing and capitalization errors, which detracted from professionalism.",

This led to the customer's actual query being unaddressed and likely resulted in an incorrect ticket status, significantly impacting the customer experience and failing to provide personalized, relevant responses.",

Additionally, the agent did not provide empathetic communication, clear next steps, or relevant responses, leading to a lack of resolution and customer dissatisfaction. Overall, while the agent showed some strengths in initiating contact, the critical failures in communication and problem-solving need urgent attention.",

I would like to inform you that the parcel has been declared lost by the carrier. However, after reviewing the product that was shipped and the carrier’s transport regulations, I must inform you that this shipment is <strong>not eligible for compensation</strong>.<br>&nbsp;<br>The item you shipped contains psychoactive truffle components, which include psilocybin and psilocin. While these substances may be legal to sell or ship within certain countries, they are <strong>not legal to import into Ireland</strong>, where your shipment was destined. According to Irish legislation, any substance or preparation that contains psilocin or an ester of psilocin is classified as a controlled drug and therefore cannot be imported under any circumstances: <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2006/si/53/made/en/print?utm_source=chatgpt.com\"><strong>Irish Statutebook (Misuse of Drugs Regulations)</strong></a><br>&nbsp;<br>UPS also explicitly prohibits the transport of any goods that are illegal in the origin or destination country. Their prohibited items list states:<br><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ups.com/nl/en/support/shipping-support/shipping-special-care-regulated-items/prohibited-items?\"><strong>UPS Prohibited Items</strong></a><br><blockquote><p dir=\"auto\"><i>“We will not transport any goods which are prohibited by law or regulation of any federal, state, or local government in the origin or destination countries… Any shipment that is prohibited by applicable law or regulation will not be transported by UPS.”</i></p></blockquote>&nbsp;<br>This means that, due to the nature of the contents, the parcel was not eligible for transport by UPS, and therefore cannot be reimbursed in the event of loss. These conditions are reinforced in the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://delivery-p55671-e392469.adobeaemcloud.com/adobe/assets/urn:aaid:aem:853befe4-a4d4-418d-9cb6-1dc416a35784/original/as/terms-carriage-nl-gb-en.pdf\"><strong>UPS Terms of Carriage</strong></a>.<br>&nbsp;<br>For these reasons, the claim cannot be approved, and no compensation can be issued. Therefore, I will now close this ticket.<br>&nbsp;<br>I wish you a great rest of your week.<br>\n\n<span class=\"collapse-signature\"></span><div class=\"signature\"><p dir=\"auto\">Kind regards,<br>\nMelania | Customer Support Consultant</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><img src=\"https://www.sendcloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sendcloudmailsignature.png\" alt=\"alt text\"></p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Check out our <strong><a href=\"https://support.sendcloud.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360046514071-How-to-get-support-from-Sendcloud\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Help Center</a></strong> to read more about how you can get support from Sendcloud.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><a href=\"https://app.sendcloud.com/v2/accounts/subscriptions/plans?utm_source=zendesk&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=fr_fr_cs_email&amp;utm_content=annual_push_banner\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://www.sendcloud.com/wp-content/help-center-images/ZD%20Content/Dutch%20Banner.png.\" alt=\"Sendcloud\"></a></p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Stadhuisplein 10 5611 EM Eindhoven | Chamber of Commerce: 66572959 | VAT number: NL856613897B01</p></div></div>",

  "ticket_conversation": "\nagent (00:03 - 00:08) Thank you for calling InCred Finance, Rishi Soma, how may I assist you today?\ncustomer (00:08 - 00:33) Hi, uh, good evening. So, uh, just wanted to check on one thing. Actually, I had scheduled some return pickup today and, uh, from that entire order, actually three things got picked up, but, uh, there are some things remaining as well, I think three more.\ncustomer (00:33 - 00:53) Uh, so the auto assigned pickup date now it's showing in the app 1st October. But actually I'll be leaving day after tomorrow and will not be available post that. So can it be possible for you to kind of reschedule it to tomorrow so that it gets picked up tomorrow, please?\nagent (00:55 - 01:02) Actually, for tomorrow it is difficult. I can see all the slots are already full for tomorrow, ma'am. We can try for a day after tomorrow.\ncustomer (01:02 - 01:08) Uh, day after tomorrow, but yeah, I mean day after tomorrow again I'm leaving.\ncustomer (01:08 - 01:18) So really, will it be possible to do it before 11:00 in the morning?\nagent (01:18 - 01:25) Oh, that is tough. Uh, okay, let me check with the warehouse team once, ma'am, then. Okay.\ncustomer (01:25 - 01:25) Yes, please.\nagent (01:25 - 01:26) Yes, please.\ncustomer (01:26 - 01:27) Uh-huh.\ncustomer (01:27 - 01:42) No, no, I was just saying actually I told the person who had come for pickup to do it tomorrow itself, half of the things. He has asked that he check with the warehouse, but if it is possible, please do it tomorrow, otherwise the things will be here and I'll be gone. I mean there'll be no one else to hand it over.\nagent (01:42 - 01:44) Give me a moment, please. Let me just check.\ncustomer (01:44 - 01:45) Yes, please.\nagent (01:45 - 01:45) Yes, please.\ncustomer (01:49 - 01:52) So, like, why they haven't picked that product? But can at least confirm?\ncustomer (01:52 - 02:01) I don't know. They just said that they'll pick up some things today and then some things later. So I requested them to do it tomorrow itself because day after tomorrow I'll not be there.\ncustomer (02:01 - 02:06) Uh, that is the thing. I don't know the reason. Probably space constraints in the vehicle, but, uh, I mean, I'm not sure.\nagent (02:06 - 02:09) I understand, ma'am. I'll check with the warehouse team.\nagent (02:09 - 02:14) May I please put your call on hold for two minutes, please? I'll check and get back to you.\ncustomer (02:14 - 02:14) Okay.\ncustomer (02:14 - 02:15) Yes, yes.\nagent (03:42 - 03:47) Hello, ma'am. Thank you for holding.\nagent (03:47 - 04:02) Ma'am, I have checked with the warehouse team, and they have informed that the product is already dispatched.\nagent (04:02 - 04:10) And it will be delivered to you by tomorrow evening, ma'am.\ncustomer (04:10 - 04:17) Okay, so tomorrow evening, you're saying?\nagent (04:17 - 04:21) Yes, ma'am, by tomorrow evening.\ncustomer (04:21 - 04:28) Okay, so what time can I expect it?\nagent (04:28 - 04:38) Ma'am, you can expect it between 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. tomorrow.\ncustomer (04:38 - 04:43) Okay, 4 p.m. to 7 p.m.\nagent (04:43 - 04:45) Yes, ma'am.\ncustomer (04:45 - 04:49) Okay, thank you so much.\nagent (04:49 - 04:51) You're welcome, ma'am.\nagent (04:51 - 04:58) Is there anything else I can assist you with?\ncustomer (04:58 - 05:00) No, that's it.\nagent (05:00 - 05:08) Thank you for calling InCred Finance, ma'am.

That is the problem.\nagent (09:01 - 09:04) No, no, we will try to get this done tomorrow itself.\nagent (09:04 - 09:07) Please please wait for some time, okay?\nagent (09:07 - 09:13) Tomorrow morning like today evening only it's already 7:00.\ncustomer (09:13 - 09:15) Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nagent (09:15 - 09:26) Okay, if it is getting added, it will you will be notified or else like I have already escalated.

Thank you so much for asking. Please tell me how can I assist you, sir?\ncustomer (00:08 - 00:36) So Soma, the thing is, uh, basically I received my, uh, one BHT combo today and there was some issue with the washing machine as it was too old, right?

But, uh, when I am going through the application, it is showing me that it will be delivered by 30th September.\ncustomer (00:36 - 00:51) So my concern was as my scheduled delivery was the 27th of September and I wanted all the products to be intact and to be new as far as I am paying for the annual package, right?\ncustomer (00:51 - 01:08) So ma'am, I would request you if at least that product can be delivered by tomorrow because it is a washing machine and it would be a basic necessity for me to wash my clothes and all.\ncustomer (01:08 - 01:11) The thing is this and it is showing me that it will be delivered by 30th September.\nagent (01:11 - 01:15) Sure sir, that date which has been assigned, that is an auto assigned date. Let me check with the team once then, okay?\ncustomer (01:15 - 01:16) Actually I\nagent (01:16 - 01:16) Yes ma'am.\ncustomer (01:16 - 01:28) Because it is an it is an off yes, because it is an auto auto assigned date. I would want that to be delivered by tomorrow because it is a single product and this is and that is very critical for me.\nagent (01:28 - 01:31) Okay, I understand. Please be on line.\ncustomer (01:31 - 01:31) Yes.\nagent (01:31 - 01:40) Let me check with the team once. Okay, because as I can see here that all slots are full for tomorrow. Let me try once, okay? So I'm putting your call on hold. Okay, please be on line.\ncustomer (01:40 - 01:40) Done ma'am.\nagent (07:39 - 07:49) Thank you for being online. Sorry for the long hold, ma'am.\nagent (07:49 - 08:10) Actually, there's no response from the team. I'm just initiating the call. Thank you for giving your valuable time to InCred Finance.\n",

The agent failed to adhere to key protocols, such as timely call opening, proper self-introduction, and hold procedures, resulting in a lack of professionalism. However, the agent demonstrated strong empathy and active listening skills, effectively acknowledging customer concerns. While the agent maintained a professional tone, there were instances of informal language usage that detracted from the overall quality of the interaction.",

So with your permission can I place the call on hold for two minutes?\ncustomer (02:27 - 02:28) Oh yes, yes.\ncustomer (02:28 - 02:39) You check because tomorrow is the only time possible because if it's not tomorrow then I don't think like whatever delay bhi ho chuka hai and nobody will be there to like navigate the drivers.\nagent (02:39 - 02:43) Okay, sir. So I'll stay online for two minutes so that I'll be checking with the team.\nagent (04:02 - 04:11) Thank you for the long wait.\ncustomer (04:11 - 04:11) Huh?\nagent (04:11 - 05:44) So, Harshith Shetty, I would like to tell you that it can be possible for tomorrow. I'm actually apologize for currently we don't have the option to schedule the activity. So instead if there is any slot is available, immediately we can ride your call. We kindly requested to please schedule your activity based on your availability through the application.\ncustomer (05:44 - 05:45) Yeah, so tomorrow.\nagent (05:45 - 06:00) Yes, sir. So currently we don't have the option to schedule it, sir. Because it is out for pickup. So now we don't have the option to schedule it. So once the status has been reached.\ncustomer (06:00 - 06:10) Yeah, I know, I know you don't have an option, but I talked to this guy from InCred only. Uh, he had scheduled for today.\ncustomer (06:10 - 06:14) Uh, it was because it is getting delayed.\ncustomer (06:14 - 06:26) So it is possible for tomorrow. I had asked that office delivery that warehouse people. I mean, he realized it is possible to do tomorrow, just to confirm with you guys.\ncustomer (06:26 - 06:34) Because if you don't schedule tomorrow, then it won't be possible ever because then it will be possible next weekend.\nagent (06:34 - 06:50) I understand, sir. So currently we don't have the option to schedule the activity for tomorrow because it is out for pickup, it is showing out for pickup. So now by the end of the day, it will just reach to you.\nagent (06:50 - 06:54) So at that time, we will be having the option to schedule the activity, sir.\ncustomer (06:54 - 06:58) Yeah, but at least get scheduled today or after that either Monday or Tuesday.\nagent (06:58 - 07:06) Yes, sir. Because as per your confirmation only, we have scheduled the activity for today, sir.\ncustomer (07:06 - 07:12) So but actually, actually, uh, I talked to you guys yesterday.\ncustomer (07:12 - 07:14) Which you guys confirmed for Sunday.\ncustomer (07:14 - 07:23) Okay, you guys confirmed for Sunday, but today morning I got the call from your manager or something.

So that is the reason the consultation.\ncustomer (07:30 - 07:32) So you mean that slot is available because.\ncustomer (07:32 - 07:35) I know you might not get the option to select for tomorrow.\nagent (07:35 - 07:39) I understand that you have to do it tomorrow.\nagent (07:39 - 07:45) So I understand, sir. But currently we don't have the option to schedule your activity, sir.\ncustomer (07:45 - 07:52) That's why can I talk to someone else like which can even make it possible because.\nagent (07:52 - 07:55) Sir, the team will be reaching out to you.\ncustomer (07:55 - 07:58) I don't I don't feel to reach out because I didn't get idea of calling.\ncustomer (07:58 - 08:04) I think very sensitive because today because I'm paying the rent there.\ncustomer (08:04 - 08:07) If you do not show that solution which I you are not picking up.\nagent (08:07 - 08:15) Yes, sir. But we understand your concern, sir. But based on the slot only, we can able to schedule your activity, sir.\ncustomer (08:15 - 08:20) So that's why like can I talk to someone else maybe your manager or someone who can be schedule as well as.\ncustomer (08:20 - 08:22) Who is not depending on the option like this.\nagent (08:22 - 08:27) I'm sorry, sir.

What is the desired outcome?   Customers should be able to select their preferred service point directly during checkout.      **The user is willing to create an account for us, but would first like to know which permissions we need. Could you please share this information with me so we can investigate the issue further?**  —  Steps to reproduce: (if not reproducible, pls add the user steps here)    1. Go to one of the customer's websites, for example: [https://www.shoebidooshoes.com/nl/cart/](https://www.shoebidooshoes.com/nl/cart/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)   2. Add a product to your shopping cart and proceed to the checkout   3. Choose a shipping method for which service points should be activated   4. Notice that the service points are not displayed, despite correct configuration in Lightspeed   5.

Do you know if the user is using the legacy checkout or the new checkout? (The legacy version would open a service point map, while the new checkout shows a list of service points)      I found this Jira - <https://sendcloud.atlassian.net/browse/SL-3028?search_id=c78e8de8-f171-4388-8614-62bbd767e073> where the issue was solved by deactivating the service points and activating it again. This applied for the new checkout.      Could you please ask the user to enable the hijack so we can test this? If this does not work then I would need access to their backend, but let's try this first.      Thanks!    Kind regards | Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  Fabian | Technical Support Specialist!

Thank you so much for asking. How about you sir?\ncustomer (00:10 - 00:43) Uh I'm doing great yeah. So the thing is I was just on call with one of your executives, I think so much on this. So she put my call on hold for a minute to get and check whether my one of the products which was delivered to me today was not up to the mark, that was a washing machine and auto assignment it was coming around 30th September.\ncustomer (00:43 - 00:57) But I will be needing that by tomorrow. Yes. So she put my call on hold to check whether we can get it delivered by tomorrow while talking to the senior. So I will be just checking the same. That is the one check that.\nagent (00:57 - 01:06) Okay sir. So definitely the same mobile number correct no? Sir Karan. Yes. Thank you so much for the confirmation. So you know that I just checked.\nagent (01:06 - 01:35) I can see so many products are there. Total 367, seven products are delivered. Only one that is a washing machine it was not delivered. Sir may I know the reason sir why they have not delivered today? Any reason?\ncustomer (01:35 - 01:47) They tried to deliver to, they tried to deliver it but when they opened the package, it was pretty old like 10 to 8 years old it was.\ncustomer (01:47 - 01:49) But it was bad.\nagent (01:49 - 01:50) Yes, yes.\nagent (01:50 - 02:19) Okay, I totally understand. And this subscription is not started because all the eight products are, um, this one right sir bundle now. So that's the reason subscription is not started. When the washing machine will be delivered then only the subscription will be started. Please hold the subscription team say on call only. I'll resolve it from Pune warehouse team and when they can deliver the product that is also I'll just check here.\ncustomer (02:19 - 02:20) Okay, okay.\nagent (02:20 - 02:21) Just allow me one minute.\ncustomer (02:21 - 02:22) Ha, thank you sir.\nagent (02:22 - 02:23) Just one minute.\nagent (02:58 - 03:38) Thank you so much for being online. I appreciate your time and understanding. I'm really sorry for the long hold, sir. Now, sir, I have informed the Pune warehouse team also. So they are mentioning, sir, because once your delivery it was reached, sir, which date purchase you can see, it will be done on the same day itself, they are mentioning. But still I have informed them.\ncustomer (03:38 - 03:51) No, that is what I'm telling you, that I have been auto assigned, uh, date has been auto assigned.\nagent (03:51 - 03:51) Correct, correct.\ncustomer (03:51 - 03:56) I want it has to be delivered by tomorrow.\nagent (03:56 - 04:27) Sir, exactly, it's possible or not because, sir, I have clearly what you have done, we have discussed on call. I have clearly, sir, what you mentioned, you want tomorrow only delivery. I have mentioned that. So they will be setting in the back end, sir. First they will be calling you before 8:00, okay, for the confirmation because they will be having a manifest higher authority, right? They have to decide when exactly they can deliver the product actually, sir. And they have to check with the warehouse also.\ncustomer (04:27 - 04:28) Okay.\nagent (04:28 - 04:48) The warehouse team, they want that the washing machine brand washing machine is in or not because that is the reason only you have rejected because it's too old, it was sent too old, no? That's the reason, sir.\ncustomer (04:48 - 04:48) Yes.\nagent (04:48 - 05:13) So please allow us some time, sir. Once you get the update, we will be informing you, okay? Because without your update, we cannot give an assurance, sir. Otherwise, you will be waiting, sir. So the customer, I will have mindset in delivery, no? That's the reason. So please allow us some time, okay? They will be checking in the back exactly the earliest they can deliver, they will go through the same.\ncustomer (05:13 - 05:13) Okay.\nagent (05:13 - 05:17) 30 you will not be available, sir?\ncustomer (05:17 - 05:18) Because it was scheduled on that day.\ncustomer (05:18 - 05:31) I will be available on 30th, but I will be available before 3:00 in the afternoon.\nagent (05:31 - 05:34) Before 3:00. Okay, okay, got it. Before 3:00 after that you will not be available.\ncustomer (05:34 - 05:37) I will be leaving office.\nagent (05:37 - 05:39) Okay, okay, I got it, sir.\nagent (05:39 - 05:45) So any update, sir, they will be informing you. So without getting an I cannot give an assurance, okay? I'm really sorry, sir.\ncustomer (05:45 - 05:45) Okay.\nagent (05:45 - 05:50) But really thank you, sir. It's my pleasure, sir. No issues.

Ben ik gelegen? 00:07 Customer Ja, denk ik. Het is 00:08 Agent het is heel kort hoor. Ik heb een situatie met DPD waarin zij aangeven dat een aantal labels vanuit jullie niet goed worden aangemeld. Zoals bijvoorbeeld dat de printkwaliteit niet goed is of dat die verkeerd geplakt is op de doos. Vandaar dat ik je eventjes bel om te kijken hoe je labels precies op de doos zitten om dit te kunnen voorkomen. 00:31 Customer Ja, maar ik moet zeggen ik ga hier eigenlijk zelf niet over, maar mag ik jou dan voor dadelijk een ander telefoonnummer geven? Zeker. Die doet dat hier en ik zit hier een hoop mensen. We hebben hier dadelijk van kwart over 10 tot half 11 hebben we pauze. Als je dan even na 10 even terug wilt tellen, dan ga ik jou even het nummer geven. 00:53 Customer Is dat nu? Je kan 00:53 Agent het eventueel ook op de mail zetten, is dat handiger? 00:57 Customer Ja, doe dan maar. Dat is nog praktischer. 00:59 Agent Ja, oké, dan ga ik dat meteen voor je doen. 01:01 Customer Nou, is geweldig. 01:02 Agent Oké, top. 01:03 Customer Oké, bedankt. Joe joe. Doei. 01:05 Agent Fijne dag, doei.

Problems reported include poor print quality or incorrect application of labels on boxes. Rene stated he does not handle this issue directly and offered to provide a different contact number later. Celine suggested emailing the details instead, which Rene agreed to as a more practical solution. Celine will follow up via email to resolve the label registration issues.

DPD Nederland heeft ons laten weten dat een groeiend aantal pakketten niet gescand kan worden vanwege problemen met de etikettering. Deze pakketten moeten handmatig opnieuw gelabeld worden, wat vertragingen veroorzaakt en in sommige gevallen zelfs bijdraagt aan verloren zendingen. Om deze problemen te helpen voorkomen en ervoor te zorgen dat je pakketten soepel worden verwerkt, vragen we je te controleren of je de volgende richtlijnen voor labels volgt: Vereisten voor etikettering Controleer de printerkwaliteit: Als je labels vaag of vlekkerig zijn, heeft je printer mogelijk onderhoud nodig. Plaats labels correct: Zorg ervoor dat de barcode op een plat, zichtbaar oppervlak wordt geplaatst en niet op de zijkant of hoek. Voorkom dat de barcode wordt bedekt: Het inpakken van pakketten in krimpfolie of tape over het label kan scannen onmogelijk maken. Bevestig slechts één label per pakket: Meerdere labels kunnen verwarring en verkeerde routering veroorzaken. Door deze stappen te nemen, help je DPD je pakketten zonder vertraging te scannen en te verzenden, wat leidt tot snellere leveringen en minder problemen voor je klanten. Ik hoop dat ik je hiermee genoeg heb geïnformeerd en zal bij deze dit ticket sluiten. Mocht je nog vragen hebben, ben je uiteraard welkom om te reageren, hierbij zal je de case heropenen. Fijne (werk)dag! 🌻️ Met vriendelijke groet / Kind regards, Celine | Customer Support Consultant Bekijk ook het Sendcloud Help Center voor meer hulp!

Op zich denk ik dat onze labels prima leesbaar zijn en in goede kwaliteit zijn gedrukt, alleen we hebben een blijvend probleem met dat ze scheef op de sticker worden geprint. Als we de jullie printinstellingen op A6 formaat zetten, zit de afdruk standaard te ver naar rechts. Zie hieronder. Als we de labels eerst downloaden en dan printen, print hij wel in het midden. Kan dit het probleem zijn dat DPD bedoelt? Ik weet dat we hier eerder een opmerking over hebben gehad. Heb jij hier misschien een oplossing voor zodat we ze niet allemaal eerst hoeven te downloaden?

Our labels are the right quality, but the print seems to be too big for the sticker. We use our label printer a lot, mostly for printing documents other than DPD labels. This means that I cannot change our printer settings only for the DPD labels, otherwise all our other labels will not be printed correctly. If I download the labels first and then print them (on the same printer settings 10x15cm), they are printed correctly. Do you know why it does not print correctly directly from Sendcloud?

This issue is taking a bit more time than usual to investigate, and it was temporarily left behind as we realized we need a bit more information from your side in order to proceed. To help us look into this more thoroughly, could you please provide us with the following details? Are you using a Mac or Windows system? What is your printer setup and preferred printing format? Could you also send us a screenshot of your Print Client settings? In general, if the PDF label appears correctly, the issue is most likely not related to Sendcloud. However, the information above will allow our team to investigate the situation more effectively and identify any potential causes🙇️ Thank you very much for your collaboration, and again, our apologies for the delay in handling this case 🙏️ We appreciate your understanding and look forward to hearing from you soon.

You can install it from there in case it hasn’t already been done. I also reviewed the information we have in our Help Center regarding printing settings, and I believe the way your labels are printed depends on exactly those settings. Here’s the link for reference: https://support.sendcloud.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032247872-Printer-settings-troubleshooting-for-Windows#h_052a1a38-b84d-448d-a2c8-19dac74bbdce Please check the section “Print quality issue”, as the settings should match what’s described there. Before printing a label, you should also see a pop-up window that allows you to adjust margins, for example — perhaps it can be fine-tuned there as well? What I’d like to suggest is that you test this by adjusting the settings as described in the article, and then check if you still experience the same issue. I understand that you don’t want these changes to be permanent since you normally use different settings for other print jobs, but would it be okay for you to just test it once? If this resolves the problem, then we’ll know for sure it’s caused by the settings for sure 🙇️ Looking forward to hearing from you, have a nice day! 🌞️ Met vriendelijke groet / Kind regards / Viele Grüße, Maria Giacalone | Customer Support Consultant Bekijk ook het Sendcloud Help Center voor meer hulp!

If the agent's failure involves ignoring a clear input or missing probing questions, this is scored as a Fail on T and results in a Troubleshooting issue only deduction. Similarly, if the failure is an incomplete, unclear, or missing solution, this is scored as a Fail on R and results in a Resolution issue only deduction. The single exception to the double-docking rule occurs when a Failed Troubleshooting directly causes a Failed Resolution; in this specific case, both T and R are scored as Fail, and the agent receives a deduction for both. Finally, if the agent tried to solve, but the customer left or ended the conversation prematurely, the R score is marked as N/A (Not Applicable), and T is scored based on the effort and quality demonstrated before the conversation ended.",

Deze code is altijd langer dan 7 tekens.  \ncustomer (2025-10-13 07:33:13): 05222387226064  \nagent (2025-10-13 07:33:17): Een momentje, ik controleer even de status van uw pakket!  \nagent (2025-10-13 07:33:18): Bedankt voor het wachten! Uw pakket wordt verzonden door DPD en de laatste bijgewerkte status is In sorteercentrum.  \nagent (2025-10-13 07:33:18): Klik op de link om de laatste trackingupdates te bekijken 👇  \nagent (2025-10-13 07:33:19): Ondervindt u problemen met dit pakket?  \ncustomer (2025-10-13 07:33:26): Ja  \nagent (2025-10-13 07:33:32): Zeker, kunt u het onderwerp voor het aanmaken van het ticket kiezen?  \ncustomer (2025-10-13 07:33:49): Problemen met de verzending  \nagent (2025-10-13 07:33:52): Selecteer hieronder het onderwerp  \ncustomer (2025-10-13 07:33:54): Andere vragen  \nagent (2025-10-13 07:34:00): Bedankt dat je dat hebt uitgekozen! 😊 Mijn geweldige mensenvriend gaat je helpen! 🙌  \nagent (2025-10-13 07:34:01): Ik ga je nu verbinden met een van mijn geweldige menselijke maatjes! Ze reageren meestal binnen een paar minuten. Bedankt voor het geduld! 😊  \nagent (2025-10-13 07:34:02): Handing over to an agent  \ncustomer (2025-10-13 07:34:04): Conversation with Nander Knobben  \nagent (2025-10-13 07:35:34): Goedemorgen, bedankt dat je contact met ons hebt opgenomen! 😄️ Ik begrijp dat er iets mis is met dit pakket 05222387226064, sorry daarvoor! 😕️ Laat me even voor je kijken 🏃️ (vertaald)  \nagent (2025-10-13 07:40:19): Ik begrijp wat je bedoelt, dit pakket is 3 dagen geleden gescand in het bezorgcentrum en sindsdien zijn er geen updates meer. Het is duidelijk dat de bezorging vertraagd is, ik begrijp dat dit vervelend is en bied de vervoerder mijn excuses aan! 😕️ De beste manier om erachter te komen wat er met dit pakket aan de hand is, is door een ticket te openen via de ondersteuningssectie van ons panel. Ben je er op de een of andere manier al mee bekend? Zo niet, dan kun je op deze link klikken: https://app.sendcloud.com/v2/support/new-ticket om een nieuw ticket te openen. Ik raad aan om in dit geval de categorie voor een vertraagd pakket te selecteren. Als dit gebeurt, wordt de vervoerder onmiddellijk op de hoogte gebracht en wordt er een onderzoek gestart aan de kant van de vervoerder. Alle informatie/vereiste documentatie wordt op dezelfde plaats opgeslagen en is beschikbaar voor zowel ons als de vervoerder. Na deze stap nemen wij de communicatie met de vervoerder namens jou af! 🙇️ Helaas zijn we voor verzendproblemen nog steeds erg afhankelijk van hen, aangezien we geen vervoerder zijn maar alleen een tussenpersoon en dit is de procedure die we hebben ingesteld als er een probleem is met de levering 🤕️ Als je meer uitleg of hulp nodig hebt bij het aanmaken van het ticket, laat het me dan gerust weten, ik help je graag verder! 🙂 (vertaald)  \ncustomer (2025-10-13 07:40:52): Goedemorgen, Ik heb een week geleden een waterfilter besteld, maar deze is nog niet geleverd. Hij zou bezorgd worden met DPD bij een pakketpunt dat ik bij verzending kon selecteren. Nu blijkt dat pakketpunt niet te bestaan. Ik zou graag het verzendadres wijzigen naar mijn thuisadres, anders gaat hij nooit aankomen. Tracking nr.: 05222387226064  \ncustomer (2025-10-13 07:41:02): het probleem is echter dat het afleveradres aangepast zou moeten worden  \ncustomer (2025-10-13 07:41:09): waar kan ik dit doen? / kan ik dit nog doen?  \nagent (2025-10-13 07:43:29): Oh, ik snap het! Dit is echt jammer moet ik zeggen 😥️ Ik kijk even voor je of een wijziging mogelijk is 🙏️ (vertaald)  \nagent (2025-10-13 07:50:32): Het lijkt erop dat DPD zelf niet de mogelijkheid biedt om de bezorging van dit pakket te wijzigen: meestal is dit mogelijk op de trackingpagina van DPD, ze bieden je de mogelijkheid om het adres of de bezorgmethode te wijzigen, maar ik zie niet dat dit in dit geval een mogelijkheid is 😥️ Aangezien het pakket echter nog steeds is gemarkeerd als zijnde in het bezorgcentrum, kan het misschien werken om een ticket te openen voor een adreswijzigingsverzoek! Via dezelfde link die ik je in mijn vorige bericht heb gestuurd, kun je een verzoek doorsturen om het adres van de bezorging te wijzigen 🙂 Helaas kan ik niet garanderen dat dit werkt, het hangt ervan af hoe snel de vervoerder de aanvraag zal ophalen, maar het is een poging die we kunnen doen! (vertaald)  \ncustomer (2025-10-13 07:51:24): Bedankt!  \nagent (2025-10-13 07:55:56): Natuurlijk, het is me een genoegen om zoveel mogelijk te helpen! Ik duimen voor dit pakket 🤞️ Voordat ik je verlaat, zou je dit berichtengesprek willen beoordelen en een reactie willen achterlaten? Op deze manier kunnen we onze service blijven verbeteren. Dit kan gedaan worden zodra onze chat is afgelopen! Bij voorbaat bedankt! 🙏️ Bedankt dat je met ons wilde praten! Als je nog vragen hebt, kun je dit gesprek opnieuw openen. Ik wens je een geweldige dag! 🌷️ (vertaald)  \nagent (2025-10-13 07:56:01): Please rate our support  \n",

Recent aapka kaafi sara bounces hua hai sir, August aur August, September, October month. \nagent (02:19 - 02:50) Toh matlab six month ke baad aapko offer aane start ho jate ho, ho jate hain. Agar recent koi bounce vagera nahi rehta hai, toh fir aap le sakte hain top up ke liye. Woh aapko applications pe check karna rehta hai. Agar offer aa raha hai toh hi aap le sakte hain.\nagent (02:50 - 03:08) Aur yahan pe main check kar pa rahi hu aapka ek application hai September month ka 26 September ko aapne top up ke liye apply kiya tha, but woh application reject ho gaya hai. Aapka kuch criteria mismatch ho raha tha us wajah se woh reject ho gaya hai.\nagent (03:08 - 03:23) Toh matlab abhi aap eligible nahi ho loan lene ke liye, kyunki yeh reject hone ke baad at least four to six month lagte hain dobara aapko offer aane ke liye. But uske andar bhi aap eligible ho rahe ho toh fir aap le sakte hain lekin recent koi bounces vagera nahi hone chahiye.\nagent (03:23 - 03:28) Maybe yeh rejection ka reason hoga ki aapka EMI bounce hua hai.\ncustomer (03:28 - 03:30) Achcha, achcha.\nagent (03:30 - 03:30) Ji.\nagent (03:31 - 03:31) Theek hai?\nagent (03:32 - 03:34) Aur koi jankari?\n",

So I've reviewed all the details of this shipment, and, unfortunately, it's delay. And, um, the last of I to be clear, the reason is unclear because the last update from DPD was August 7. And usually, for shipment from Belgium to The Netherlands, only takes less than 3 days.\nagent (2025-08-12 15:16:34): Since there's no more updates since August 7, a ticket is definitely needed to find out where the shipment is.\ncustomer (2025-08-12 15:16:40): Okay. But I need this order. I can't wait too long. So what should I do?\nagent (2025-08-12 15:16:46): Right now, what you can do is you need to create a ticket. And if I know this is urgent, so I would suggest sending another replacement shipment.\ncustomer (2025-08-12 15:16:57): Yeah. And that yeah. And, yeah, and then who will pay for for the for the order then?\nagent (2025-08-12 15:17:03): Yeah. So this is what happens when you yeah. When you create a ticket for this shipment right now, if it's determined lost by DPD, you will get your money back including shipping cost and the money for the item.\ncustomer (2025-08-12 15:17:20): Yeah. It's for the order of €142.\nagent (2025-08-12 15:17:24): Yeah. Like Yes.\ncustomer (2025-08-12 15:17:25): But do you I will get the whole the whole, uh, I will get them the whole order.\nagent (2025-08-12 15:17:30): Mhmm. Do you have, like, a invoice for this shipment, like, a sales invoice?\ncustomer (2025-08-12 15:17:36): Yeah. Yeah. Of course. Yeah. Yeah.\ncustomer (2025-08-12 15:17:37): Yeah. As long\nagent (2025-08-12 15:17:38): as you can, yeah, as long as you can provide that, you will get your money back, my full money back, and you'll also get the shipping cost back. So right now, I would suggest you send a new shipment to your customer. And for this 1, create a ticket to start an investigation. So DVD would take a look at this, and I can pretty confidently confidently say that it's probably lost. So you would definitely get your money back.\ncustomer (2025-08-12 15:18:08): Okay.

However, there were notable areas for improvement, including the lack of a proper closure script, failure to ask if further assistance was needed, and insufficient use of the customer's name and empathetic language. Overall, while the agent demonstrated some adherence to quality standards, several key aspects require attention to enhance customer experience.",
